# signal-processing-1-sampling-and-quatisizing
We process the signal of audio 

1. Basic MATLAB Language 

a. Create a 5 seconds sinusoidal signal of 1kHz; 
 Sampling frequency: 48kHz; 
 use command plot; 

b. Plot the symmetrical FFT of the signal; 
 use command fft and fftshift; 

c. Quantize the signal with 4 bits; 

d. Save and listen to the signal;  use function wavwrite; 

Extra point: load an audio file and quantize it with fewer bits until the  quantization noise is audible.
